Heart failure, sometimes known as congestive heart failure, occurs when your heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs 
for blood and oxygen. Certain conditions, such as narrowed arteries in your heart or high blood pressure, gradually leave your heart too weak or 
stiff to pump efficiently. When these conditions are identified, medical treatments can be employed to reduce the chance on having heart condition.
Lifestyle changes, such as exercising, reducing sodium in your diet, managing stress, and losing weight, can also reduce the like hood of a heart 
failure event.

One way to prevent heart failure is to understand health conditions and patientsâ€™ traits that lead to cause heart failure, such as coronary artery 
disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity. Therefore, the use of mathematical models is employed by the medical community to identify the
appropriate lifestyle practices or changes those patients can follow to avoid health issues, as heart failure.

The predictive models for predicting a heart failure event were created on the dataset published in Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data). The dataset contains twelve (12) features, that can be used to predict mortality by 
heart failure, such as high blood pressure, smoking habits, platelets and diabetes.

Performance Indicator:
Akaike's Information Criterion is an indicator of performance of the model. Lowe the value of AIC, better is the performance of the model.
