Supervised machine learning  approach, data used to train model should have labels along with feature data. It can be Regression or Classification.

#Regression
The labelled data i.e the target variable in case of Regression is continous.

Regression models are used to predict continous target variables for instance, predict salary based on experience and education, sales prediction, 
cab price prediction and so on.

#Classification
The labelled data i.e the target variable in case of Classification is categorical.

In the above example we already know ahead tha label for each of the images used to train the data. we build the model and fit it on 
the features and labels of training data and later try to predict the label of the test data. In general we hold a small subset of data to test 
our predictions. However, in reality the test set is always unknown data.
