As everything in this world is connected, understanding the Network-based perspective of complex systems is very important.
May it be engineerig, finance, professional networks, political science or dark / terrorist networks.

The aim of this project is to understand the political and social interactions shaped by social networks. The dataset used has been taken from UCNet. 
The dataset comprises the information of the individual involved directly / indirectly in the Madrid train blast. Tried to analyse the how the group 
has evolved and their interaction before and after the incident has happened. Unlike the social networks, dark networks operate in a discreet manner.
The activities are quite intense before the attack and once the plan has been successfully executed, they try to keep their interactions as less as possible
so as to not to disclose their identity.
