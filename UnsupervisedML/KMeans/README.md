What is K-Means:
In cluster analysis, the k-means algorithm can be used to partition the input data set into k partitions (clusters).

Is it supervised or unsupervised?
Unsupervised as there is no label or target variable.

# Input and output of KMeans
Input: k = number of clusters to be created.
Output: The data points are clustered into k clusters

# Application of KMeans
1. document clustering
2. identifying crime-prone areas
3. customer segmentation
4. insurance fraud detection
5. public transport data analysis
6. clustering of IT alerts
