# Data Augumentation
Data augmentation is a set of techniques to artificially increase the amount of data by generating new data points from existing data. This includes making small changes to data or using deep learning models to generate new data points. Data Augumentation can help to increase the amount of relevant data in your dataset.

Data augmentation is useful to improve performance and outcomes of machine learning models by forming new and different examples to train datasets. If the dataset in a machine learning model is rich and sufficient, the model performs better and more accurately.

types of data augmentation:
padding
random rotating
re-scaling,
vertical and horizontal flipping
translation ( image is moved along X, Y direction)
cropping
zooming
darkening & brightening/color modification
grayscaling
changing contrast
adding noise
random erasing
